5,"Good. Very arranged app, simple to use. Great effort. I would like to suggest an edit to the app. It is to keep a tag on the voice msgs we send and receive to quickly know what does it say so that without playing it we can understand it.

5,I love the recent updates. Love the new emojis. But It's important to update in the blocked contacts. It will be good to delete an blocked contact from the list. Another problem that I face is I get calls from unknown numbers. So I think there will be an update about that.Thank you.
5,"This App is very useful in create classroom groups as well as family groups. After creating the groups, we can change settings to send messages. But when it comes to the Group Description, any one in the group can change. It must be restricted."

5,Extremely fantabulas application to communicate with others. I've used it a lot and it always helped me to continue my online study. But a thing which I think the developer should change is to lighten the theme which is deep green and should have light green. üí®üí®

5,"Best app. Very convenient and user friendly. I only wish it had one option wherein one could logout of whatsapp without uninstalling it, just the same way we logout of Facebook. This will stop the notifications for a certain period of time without having to put off the data."
5,Very efficient app. Fast messaging but I would be much better if you add on the time status pictures take to disappear. They switch so quickly. Sometimes we share statuses with word quotes so we need enough seconds to read them.
5,"Excellent app.... But I had some suggestions... I suggest you to add superhero faced emojis such as iron man, captain America etc... That would be really fun and I would really appreciate if you did so... Overall app is great.. Keep it up!!!üòçüòçüòç"
5,This app is good. But it would have been even better if it had inbuilt language translator like ablo app. It would help people of different countries to communicate in their own language without knowing each others language.

5,Great app. I've never had any problems with the app itself. The only thing I don't like about it is that there's so many scammers using WhatsApp. Can be easily blocked tho.

5,"Great app, it is very useful, I m very happy with it, u can also use it without a sim card in the device but u obviously need a phone number üòäüòäüòä"
5,It's Good but whatsaap should change different chat color only wallpaper can change but if whatsaap occur new chat them like messenger then it will be owesome please. Same color of chat don't like it.
5,I Updated my whatsapp just now and i got new feature of payment and it is good and amzing.. my request is that plz add the view balance option and one prob is that we send money only when someone requested that...work on it...
5,"This app is amazing but the only problem you need to fix is allowing a user to set restrictions to who would see their profile ,the same way it is with the status"
5,This is an amazing app .. able to connect with long lost Friends..but please do me a favor by showing the person who are active should be shown clearly.. please ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
5,"i love this app but i don't like the new way of wallpaper whatsapp , its so miserable. i just love the same wallpaper to all chat as before. i just hope whatsapp can change like before."
5,"WhatsApp is a must for everyone who has a smartphone, I find it's the only way to communicate with family and friends & it's far cheaper to phone someone on WhatsApp. Thanks for such a wonderful app."
5,I just don't like it's one feature in which swiping downward while watching video status takes us to the next status which is not in the case of watching picture status.
5,"I feel this app is good...it is easy to transfer the images,videos etc...and a video chat...and a person who doesn't know to type they can mszes through voice record....totally like this lot....,‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,None can give less than 5 star. But please 1 request. Please add some function thus we can change how long our status will appear instead of 24 hours.
5,"Call ended because there is a problem with your phone's microphone. Try restarting your phone and try again"". I m getting this when i use video call.. please help"
5,"it is very good, FREE!! I have been using WhatsApp for a very long time. I like the updates as they come. keep up the good work WhatsApp"
5,"U have no idea about it,its really great for chating,calling,video chatting and... But I think telegram is more smoother than WhatsApp and also telegram let u to customize your chat settings betterüòâüòä‚úã"
5,It is good..but it bothers me that it must be updated almost twice a month..and also fails to restore my important chats..!!!
5,This is the best app I have ever used for communications but can you make it possible to put audio directly on status instead of screen recording
5,Useful app. Thanks. One suggestion is that user must get notified to reduce space rather than auto delete images and videos after 30 days.
5,"Great app works smoothly and everything. Is there anyway I may be able to change privacy settings for each individual chat? For instance, read receipts. Also can I have an emoji of someone pinching the bridge of their nose? 'Cause God knows I need it üò≠"
5,"Its like the best app for chatting you dont only chat but you can call, vedio call ,and even post pictures or videos on your status ."
5,This app was very useful and communicating with my friends it is good app. Make phone calls with clear voice and video calls clear calls over the internet
5,I had use still now all the apps but really whatsapp is one of the best app in all because it also use less net compair to other app and all the thinks we get in the app but just i think that bring some new and intersting things ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5,I am facing problem with broadcast msg if I send any msg through broadcast then no 1 is getting msg I had talked to lots of friends they are also facing problem with broadcast so please do the needful soon
5,This is a great app but one suggestion which I want to be added is - to show time on which the person seen the message which we forwarded. I hope this feature will be soon added ü•∞ü•∞
5,"This app is amazing, for massasing and share media,location etc.. But, it should be more better if it have a option for save the videos of statuses."
5,Why don't you add a feature to jump to a specific date in the chat window to avoid all the scrolling one have to do.
5,"All good whatsup is so useful app. I want to suggest small thing that ,it could be more better when we have the option to lock particular chat,juz improve this"
5,My experience with this app is good it is a faster way to communicate with the relatives. I now no longer need the airtime to talk to then i just whtp them
